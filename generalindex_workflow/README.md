# GeneralIndex-Workflow
A workflow for the public resource known as 'The General Index'. The database consists of metadata, keywords and n-gram tables for a very large amount of scholarly publications.

For metadata, run metadata_workflow.sh file using bash on a place with at least 70GB of storage.

The Jupyter notebooks can be used to explore the General Index metadata once the PostgreSQL database has been set up.

Most code is commented for interpretability
